# Beamforming test

Beamforming is a spatial filtering technique used in e.g. ultrasound appliances and radar that can be used to focus a signal on a specific target in space. Beamforming can also be used on array probes to localize from where in space a signal comes from. This small MATLAB script implements a simple beamforming algorithm that is used to enhance ultrasound images. The ultrasound images used was collected at LTH on a gelatine phatom patient
